# Air Steering Wheel

## Goal
The aim of this project is to build an app that let's you play a racing game without a 1000€ Logitech steering wheel. The name could be Steering Wheel Air, but I'm afraid Apple could sue me if I get too far... 

Anyways the result should be quite funny, just sitting in a chair, driving a car with a non existent steering wheel, not psycho at all haha
